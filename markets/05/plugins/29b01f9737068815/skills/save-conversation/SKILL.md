# Save a conversation

Save only when the user asks. Capture durable decisions, facts, and conclusions;
omit greetings, clarifying one-liners, and tool-call chatter.

## Choose the space

Call `goodmem_spaces_list` first. Reuse an obviously matching space or create one
named for the topic, not the date. If the user supplies a name, use it exactly.
Tell the user which space you chose. Keep using that space if they save more of
the same session later.

If no embedder is configured, follow the Quick Start steps in
`using-goodmem-memory`. After setup, list spaces again and reuse a suitable space
before creating another.

## Save self-contained exchanges

Create one memory per useful exchange with both sides present:

```text
Q: What did we decide about the vendor contract?
A: We chose Cooperativa San Rafael at 6.80 USD/kg, quarterly shipments,
   pending legal review of the termination clause.
```

Call `goodmem_memories_create` once per pair with metadata such as
`{"type":"qa_pair","topic":"vendor contract"}`. Never save a bare answer that
will lose its meaning outside the current chat.

## Include shared documents

A document discussed in the saved conversation is part of what the user asked to
keep. Follow `work-with-documents` to upload each original attachment as one
memory with `goodmem_memories_upload`; do not transcribe it into per-page text
memories. Use metadata connecting it to the conversation, and name the document
in the related Q&A answer so later retrieval connects them. Use text creates for
pasted text or explicitly requested excerpts.

If a file cannot be uploaded or GoodMem reports a processing failure, explain
the problem while preserving the useful discussion. Do not silently replace the
original with a transcription or claim that an unsaved file was retained.

## Confirm the result

Report the space name, number of Q&A pairs, and documents saved. If processing is
still underway, distinguish "saved" from "searchable" and follow the processing
rules in `using-goodmem-memory`.

Confirm the specific memory before deletion. Never bulk-delete unless the user
explicitly covers the whole set.
