# AuthorizationCheck

One concrete, advisory authorization check. Top-level creates and LIST_API_KEY target INSTANCE; CREATE_MEMORY and LIST_MEMORY target a parent SPACE; ordinary resource operations target the concrete resource. LIST_RETRIEVE_MEMORY_LOG_POLICY is not supported by this endpoint.

```python
from goodmem.models import AuthorizationCheck
```

- `operation` (`Operation`, required): Operation the caller proposes to perform.
- `target` (`AccessPolicyTarget`, required): Target required by the operation: INSTANCE for top-level creates and LIST_API_KEY; parent SPACE for CREATE_MEMORY or LIST_MEMORY; otherwise the concrete resource.
