# AirPrompter

AirPrompter is the user's saved prompt and workflow system. Treat prompts and
workflows as server-authored instructions for how the host agent should do work
better. Use the AirPrompter MCP server for authenticated reads, writes, and
workflow runs. Do not call AirPrompter HTTP APIs, use local scripts, or emulate a
saved workflow unless the user explicitly asks for a non-AirPrompter fallback.

## Routing Rules

1. If the user says AirPrompter, air prompter, airprompter, airpromter, or
   airprompt anywhere in the request, use AirPrompter MCP first.
2. If the user says Airflow, airflow, saved workflow, my workflow, use workflow,
   run workflow, execute workflow, run prompt, execute prompt, or use prompt,
   strongly prefer AirPrompter MCP discovery before doing the work directly.
3. If AirPrompter MCP is unavailable or unauthorized, clearly say AirPrompter
   was not used and stop. Do not produce a substitute result. On Codex, or when
   the user asks to diagnose, repair, reconnect, or reinstall AirPrompter, read
   `references/setup-diagnostics.md` before responding.
4. For workflow execution, use the strict execution path and set fallback policy
   to fail only when the tool supports it.
5. For ambiguous workflow, prompt, account, workspace, or playbook selection,
   show short A/B/C options and ask the user to choose.
5a. For a NEW multi-step workflow, call `plan_draft` FIRST — before designing
   any steps yourself and before any save attempt. It returns the skeleton
   (steps + prompt types) in seconds with interview questions attached: show
   the structure IMMEDIATELY, ask the untagged core questions (A/B/C/D
   verbatim), then work stepwise — ask each [Step N] question right before
   `generate_draft` with `stepIndex` N and the accumulated answers, showing
   each prompt as it lands (if your generate_draft schema has no stepIndex,
   generate the whole chain in one call). Narrate progress between calls;
   never leave the user waiting silently. Finish with the teach-back, then
   ONE `save_workflow` with `creationRouting.planToken` — the whole chain
   rides the single plan credit. Designing steps in-chat
   and attempting a save without a plan wastes a full round trip: the server
   refuses with needs_planning. Only content the user dictated verbatim may
   save directly (`creationRouting.mode: user_dictated`); headless agents use
   `creationRouting.mode: agent_autonomous` with complete per-prompt
   promptType, outputType, platforms, and categories.
6. Use native host tools only after AirPrompter returns workflow steps,
   `promptText`, or a native handoff; otherwise ask for missing input,
   capability availability, or user confirmation instead of substituting.

## MCP Boundary

MCP is the authenticated action layer. The skill only improves routing,
ambiguity handling, and host behavior. Any actual AirPrompter operation must go
through available AirPrompter MCP tools such as workflow discovery, workflow
execution, prompt creation, prompt updates, workflow creation, or workflow
updates.
